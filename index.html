            <p>Hey there, I'm <strong>Jessica!</strong> Currently, you can find me studying Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm interested in using technology to help people be successful and impactful, specifically in the context of education and entrepreneurship. My passions include blogging, <a href="https://jessicaslaughter.co/blog/category/blogging/coding/" target="_blank">teaching others about coding</a>, entrepreneurship, and exploring the arts to improve myself as an engineer. After graduation, I'll be joining Google as an Engineering Resident.</p> 
            <p>On the side, I run a <a href="https://jessicaslaughter.co" target="_blank">lifestyle blog</a> read by hundreds of thousands of high school and college aged women where I write about college life, wellness, and other personal ramblings. I've had the opportunity to collaborate with several brands over the years, including Target, PayPal, Dove, Society6, and Evernote, through sharing authentic stories about their products.</p>
